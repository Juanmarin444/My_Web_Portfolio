# Welcome to My Web Portfolio!

Hi! I'm glad to see you're checking out my **Web Portfolio**. If you want to learn about how I made my portfolio, you can **read me.**

Be sure to visit my [**Web Portfolio Here**](https://juanmarin.netlify.app/)!
Also, if you want to play with the responsiveness, you can use the developer tools to view the media queries.

# Tools that helped me

My site uses a few different **packages** to ensure functionality throughout. Check them out below!

## React

I used React to create my Web Portfolio. React is an open-source library used for **handling the view layer** and can be used for the development of both web and mobile applications.

## Framer Motion

I used the **framer-motion** npm package to add a fun animation to the hamburger menu button that appears when you're on mobile.

Framer Motion is a library used to add creativity to your projects. It can be used for really cool stuff such as:
- Spring animations
- Simple keyframes syntax
- Gestures (drag/tap/hover)
- Layout and shared layout animations
- SVG paths
...and way more!

Check out their **[Website!](https://www.framer.com/motion/)**

## React-responsive

React-responsive is an **npm package** that allows you to create truly **responsive designs** in your React projects. It uses the combined power of media queries and breakpoints to define DOM elements the developer wants to show and hide. Which is how I used it to display either the mobile navigation bar or not! It's a powerful tool in your arsenal as a React developer.

Go visit their **[Website](https://contra.io/react-responsive/modules.html#useMediaQuery)** for more details!

## React-router-dom

React Router is a standard library system built on top of React and used to create routing in a React application. It provides the synchronous URL on the browser with data that will be displayed on the web page. It maintains the standard structure and behavior of the application and is mainly used for developing single-page web applications.

# Visuals

The **visual** material on your **website** is **crucial** to keeping your visitors engaged. As a result, it is critical to developing a clear message.

## Figma

I used Figma to create a third of the visuals on my Web Portfolio. Figma is a **vector graphics editor** and **prototyping tool** that is also **primarily web-based!** I found it randomly one day just by surfing the web, and I instantly fell in love! I recommend you try it if you want to create awesome SVGs for your websites. It’s very easy to learn! Although, I recommend finding a tutorial somewhere if you want to use it to its full potential.

Also, here's a **[Link](https://www.figma.com/resources/learn-design/)** to a **Design Tutorial** on Figma!

## Ezgif

Ezgif is a simple online GIF maker and toolset for basic animated GIF editing. With it, you can create, resize, crop, reverse, optimize, and apply some effects to GIFs. I used it to create demo gifs of my other projects. It’s easy to use and very helpful!

## Color Hunt

Founded by Gal Shir, Color Hunt is an open **collection of color palettes**. This tool serves thousands of color schemes for many different design and art purposes. If you're **struggling** with color ideas and all your projects are looking **monotonous** check this tool out!

> **Note:** The **Color Hunt** tool can be added as a Chrome Extension called **Color Tab**.

# Deployment

Deploying your Web Portfolio is very important in the sense that you want people to see it.

Take a gander a what I used to deploy this project!

## Netlify

Netlify **works by connecting to your GitHub repository to pull your source code**, then it typically runs a build process to pre-render all of your pages in static HTML. In a nutshell, Netlify creates its own kind of repository that pushes both to a Github repository and its own microservices.

- Netlify simplifies the process for developers to deploy and host a website.
- It does all the work for them that they probably don't want to spend too much time or effort on.
- It also provides several beneficial features too!
- User identity, Serverless functions, Instant forms, Split testing & rollouts, Analytics, Large media
- Netlify also provides pretty good **[Documentation](https://docs.netlify.com/)** if you run into any bugs.
